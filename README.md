### Abstract
This project aims to implement a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** in Python and apply it to the prediction of molecule solubility. The dataset used is the [ESOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564) dataset that contains 1128 molecules and their solubility values, which is included in the `MoleculeNet` module of `torch_geometric`. A simple GNN is trained on the ESOL dataset and the performance of the GNN is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) metric. The GNN is able to achieve a MSE of **xxx** on the ESOL dataset, which is comparable to the performance of other machine learning models on the same dataset.
